# lat.md conventions this project enforces

`lat check` fails on every rule below. They are not style preferences. This
block is generated and a later `lat init` replaces it — record project guidance
in `lat.md/`, never here.

## Every document goes in a Diátaxis mode directory

A document belongs in exactly one of four subdirectories, and `lat check mode`
enforces one shape rule for each:

| Directory | Holds | Shape rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lat.md/tutorials/` | a guided first pass for someone new | an ordered list of steps, and a stated outcome |
| `lat.md/how-to/` | a recipe for a task that recurs | an ordered list of steps |
| `lat.md/reference/` | lookup facts: fields, states, limits, names | no narrative prose — no second paragraph under a heading |
| `lat.md/explanation/` | why the design is what it is | no imperative commands |

Do not write documents at the top of `lat.md/`. The root index is the only file
that belongs there. When it carries `require-mode: true`, a document with no
declared mode and no mode directory is a `lat check` error.

**A document that fails its mode is usually two documents.** A file that lists
the states *and* argues for the design is mixed: the lookup half goes in
`reference/`, the reasoning half in `explanation/`, and each links the other.
Filing it under one mode and softening the prose until the check passes is the
wrong repair. So is leaving it at the top level where no check can see it.

Classify before writing, not after. If a `diataxis` skill is available, use it.

## Every project has at least one `@lat:` code ref

`lat check` fails a tree that has documents and no `@lat:` ref anywhere in the
codebase. A graph nothing points at cannot be reached from the code, which is
the only reason it exists.

Start at the application entrypoint — `config/application.rb`, `src/index.ts`,
`main.go`, `manage.py`, whatever a new reader opens first — and point it at the
root index:

```ruby
# @lat: [[lat#Acme]]
module Acme
```

Then one ref per section that source code actually implements, placed at that
code. Never in a block at the top of a file.

### An `@lat:` pointer is exempt from this project's comment conventions

A repository that minimises, budgets, or forbids comments is right about prose
comments and does not reach this one. An `@lat:` line is a machine directive,
in the same class as `# frozen_string_literal:` or `// eslint-disable`. It
carries no rationale, asserts nothing a reader could dispute, and cannot rot
quietly — `lat check` fails the moment its target moves or disappears.

Add the ref. Then, if the reasoning that would have been a comment is worth
keeping, put it in a `lat.md/explanation/` section and let the pointer reach it.

### The marker is a comment syntax, not a language allowlist

`//` for C-family languages; `#` for Ruby, Python, shell, Elixir, YAML, Make,
and everything else that comments with `#`. The scan is textual and walks every
non-markdown file in the project, so every language works.

Any list of example languages you find is a list of examples. Never conclude a
language is unsupported because it is absent from one. `lat check` prints what
it scanned:

```
Scanned 41 .md, 622 .rb, 118 .tsx in 1.2s
```

Read that line rather than guessing, and if you are still unsure, add one ref
and run the check. It costs one command.

(The tree-sitter grammars limit only `[[src/file.ts#symbol]]` wiki links, which
resolve a symbol inside source. `@lat:` refs point the other way and have no
such limit.)

## Test specs are wired to their tests

A document describing tests declares it in frontmatter:

```markdown
---
lat:
  require-code-mention: true
---
```

Every leaf section then needs exactly one `@lat:` comment at the test that
covers it, and every section needs at least one sentence saying what it
verifies and why. `lat check` reports any spec section no test claims, and any
ref pointing at no section.
