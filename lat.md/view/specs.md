# View Tests

Functional specifications for the local browser server, client navigation, and `lat ui` startup.

## Serves the document index and browser shell

The loopback server exposes the visible Markdown index, redirects its root to the vault index, and serves the client shell for document routes.

## Renders Markdown with navigable local links

Markdown becomes safe HTML with GitHub-style heading ids while ordinary relative links retain their destinations and fragments.

## Searches sections with embeddings

Search debounces embedding queries and renders ranked section summaries linked to their document anchors.

The URL preserves the latest query; Back restores it, and Escape clears the query before returning to the page that opened search.

## Exposes code-mention frontmatter as metadata

Documents expose [[markdown#Frontmatter#require-code-mention]] separately from rendered HTML so the browser can badge files that require code references.

## Resolves Markdown and source wiki links

Resolved Markdown sections and validated source definitions become client-side links, while unresolved wiki targets remain authored text.

Unaliased code links show a language badge and visually separate muted path context from the final target.

## Serves source definitions securely

Source routes return supported project files and optional symbol ranges while rejecting traversal, unsupported extensions, missing symbols, and files outside the project root.

## Shows source reference context

Source links preserve their originating section and line so the code view can render the linking paragraph, emphasize the selected link, and expose other referencing sections.

## Shows section back-references

Referenced sections expose distinct linking Markdown paragraphs, wiki references, and `@lat:` code locations with navigable context.

## Updates long-running views incrementally

Changing, adding, or deleting project files updates cached documents, navigation, source references, and backlinks without rereading unchanged Markdown files.

Browser clients receive a change event and refresh the current route while keeping its URL and viewport stable.

## Refreshes search after Markdown changes

The first search indexes lazily, while a later Markdown generation triggers exactly one shared incremental indexing pass before new queries run.

## Shows live validation errors

Invalid Markdown files show a sidebar marker propagated through every ancestor directory, plus a top metadata error label whose entries jump to red-marked authored content.

The initial snapshot and every refresh recompute diagnostics from cached syntax trees, removing markers immediately when errors are fixed.

## Shows live Git state

Git worktrees show cached HEAD changes as yellow modified or green new-file markers, split with red for validation errors, while rendered Markdown highlights removed and added words inline.

Startup reads Git once, and a later vault change refreshes that state. The top Git toggle hides or reveals both sidebar markers and inline diffs without changing the underlying files.

The Git button retains an orange notification dot whenever changes exist, independent of the toggle state.

## Places context within a collapsed source window

Focused source views place reference context before the highlighted definition, keep five surrounding lines, and reveal collapsed code without moving the visible anchor.

## Highlights source syntax safely

Supported languages receive server-side token coloring while HTML-like source remains escaped and multiline tokens retain their styling.

## Builds a nested file tree

Vault paths form a natural-order hierarchy with root and directory index files pinned first and complete paths retained for navigation.

Selecting a directory opens its `name/name.md` index and keeps the directory expanded.

## Stabilizes fragment navigation immediately

Fragment links position rendered documents without smooth scrolling so content is immediately interactive.

## Restores history scroll positions

In-app navigation records each viewport and restores it before revealing content reached through Back.

Search waits for asynchronous results before restoring its saved viewport.

## Rejects files outside the Markdown vault

The document API rejects traversal and non-Markdown targets so browser requests cannot read arbitrary project files.

## Launches the browser after the server starts

`lat ui` starts listening before passing the loopback URL to the platform browser launcher and reports the same URL to the terminal.
