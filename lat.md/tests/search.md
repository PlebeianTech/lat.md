# Search

Tests in `tests/search.test.ts`.

## Provider Detection

Unit tests (always run). Verify `detectProvider` (now exported from
[[packages/embed/src/remote.ts#detectProvider]] in `@lat.md/embed`) correctly identifies OpenAI
(`sk-`), Vercel (`vck_`), rejects Anthropic (`sk-ant-`) with a helpful message, and rejects unknown
prefixes.

## RAG Tests

Functional tests that exercise the full RAG pipeline using the **local MiniLM engine**, which
produces deterministic vectors — so they run the real WASM embedder directly, with no API key, no
network, and no replay recording.

The test covers indexing, hashing, vector insert, and KNN search. Fixture lives in
`tests/cases/rag/lat.md/` (9 sections across 2 files). A supplementary `search (rag, hosted replay)`
group exercises the hosted `fetch` backend against a local OpenAI-compatible replay server
(`tests/rag-replay-server.ts`); it runs only when `tests/cases/rag/replay-data/` is present and is
re-cooked with `pnpm cook-test-rag` if hosted chunking changes.

### Indexes all sections

Index the RAG fixture (9 sections across 2 files), verify counts.

### Finds auth section for login query

Search for "how do we handle user login and security?" and verify the Authentication section ranks
first.

### Filters results below the similarity threshold

Semantic search returns only candidates at or above the requested cosine-similarity threshold so
callers can trade recall for less low-relevance noise.

### Applies the shared default similarity threshold

Every semantic-search path applies [[src/search/search.ts#DEFAULT_SEARCH_THRESHOLD]] unless its public interface supplies an
explicit override, keeping CLI, MCP, hooks, and UI ranking policy aligned.

### Applies the shared default result limit

CLI, MCP, and prompt-hook semantic search use [[src/search/search.ts#DEFAULT_SEARCH_LIMIT]] unless a caller explicitly overrides it; the UI retains its named presentation-specific limit.

### Finds performance section for latency query

Search for "what tools do we use to measure response times?" and verify the Performance Tests
section ranks first.

### Debug output includes similarity scores

Search result formatting includes each cosine-similarity score when debug output is requested and
keeps scores out of the normal output.

### Deterministic embeddings

Embedding the same text twice yields byte-identical vectors — the property that lets the local RAG
tests run the real engine without recording fixtures.

### Incremental index skips unchanged sections

Re-index unchanged content, verify all sections reported as unchanged with zero re-embedding.

### Detects deleted sections when file is removed

Remove `testing.md`, re-index, verify 4 sections removed and 5 architecture sections remain.

### Reads each file once when indexing

A passthrough `readFile` spy verifies indexing reads each `lat.md` file a bounded number of times
however many sections it holds: the parser reads it once and section slicing reuses that read.

Before this was pinned, a 3.5 MB file holding 12k sections was re-read once per section — 12k
times on every search.

### Rebuilds a legacy cache with no recorded model

Seed a 1536-dim `sections` table with rows but no `meta.embedding_model`, then run a local-backed
search: the mismatched table is dropped and rebuilt at 384 dims and the query succeeds.

This is the pre-versioning `.cache` upgrade path — before, the stale table was queried and threw a
raw dimension-mismatch error.

### Reuses an indexed search session

An indexed search session opens its database and embedder once, applies each query's limit and threshold, resolves known section ids, and closes owned resources exactly once.

### Skips an unbuilt search index

Opening a query-only session before an index exists returns no matches without loading an embedder, while still closing the database cleanly.

### Patches generated WASM loading explicitly

The package build replaces wasm-bindgen's opaque filesystem loader with an explicit byte initializer that is idempotent and discoverable by deployment tracers.

### Rejects unknown generated WASM glue

The package build fails clearly when generated wasm-bindgen output no longer contains the loader shape Lat knows how to replace.
